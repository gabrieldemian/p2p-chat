To start sending messages, you first need to know your friend multiaddr. Look for a log that starts with "/ip4/192..." and send to your friend.
1. Alice - listen for events: `RUST_LOG=info cargo run`
2. Bob - dial Bob multiaddr: `RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --peer /ip4/x.x.x.x/tcp/xxxxx`
Now they are connected and can start sending messages on the terminal.
